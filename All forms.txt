Technical Implementation Notes
Form Libraries: All forms use custom React components with shadcn/ui library components
Validation: Mix of HTML5 validation (required attributes) and controlled components
State Management: Local useState hooks in each component
Submission: Currently using preventDefault() - forms show toast notifications but don't submit to backend
UI Framework: shadcn/ui components (Input, Button, Select, Textarea, Label)
Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom brand colors (brand-teal, brand-peach)
Recommendations
Backend Integration: Currently all forms prevent default submission - needs API integration
Form Validation: Consider adding more robust client-side validation beyond HTML5
Form State Management: Could consolidate duplicated logic across contact forms
Analytics: Add tracking for form views, interactions, and submissions
Accessibility: Ensure all form labels are properly associated with inputs
