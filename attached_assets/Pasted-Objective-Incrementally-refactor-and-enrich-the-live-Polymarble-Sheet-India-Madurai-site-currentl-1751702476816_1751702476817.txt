Objective: Incrementally refactor and enrich the live Polymarble Sheet India (Madurai) site—currently a single page with Hero, About, Gallery, Projects, Contact, Footer—by injecting new content, micro‑interactions, and four deep‑dive pages, all in line with the strategic plan.

1. OVERHAUL EXISTING SECTIONS
Hero

Replace headline with

Your Vision, Cast in Polymer Stone

Sub‑headline:

Design without Limits. Install in Hours.

Background: implement layered parallax of marble veins (three depth layers moving at staggered speeds).

CTA Button: “Get a Free Sample” → opens sample‑request modal with micro‑interaction ripple + “clink” sound.

About

Convert into two‑panel horizontal timeline:

Left panel: Founder’s “Aha!” moment narrative (50–75 words).

Right panel: Key milestones (first 100 installs, Chennai launch, R&D lab).

Styling: minimal icons + fade‑in on scroll.

Gallery

Swap static grid for a full‑width, auto‑playing carousel of ultra‑close‑up texture loops (MP4, muted, loop).

On desktop hover: add a subtle 3D “tilt” perspective effect.

Mobile: pinch‑to‑zoom enabled.

Projects

Rename to “Case Studies.”

List three featured installs with:

Project title & location.

Before → During → After narrative (25–30 words each).

ROI callout: “Saved ₹ X per sq.ft. vs. natural marble.”

“Show me more” infinite‑scroll button with flip‑slab animation.

Filtering controls at top: Residential | Commercial | Exterior | Healthcare.

Contact & Footer

Sticky “Quick Quote” sidebar on screens ≥ 768 px: collapsed icon that expands into a two‑field micro‑form (sq.ft. + email/phone).

Footer redline: add newsletter signup—

Stay Polymarble‑Informed
[Email input] [Subscribe]
“Get our 12‑page Guide: How to Choose the Perfect Polymarble Finish.”

Local Info: ensure address, phones, email link, Instagram link are all present and click‑to‑call/mail.

2. ADD NEW PAGES & SECTIONS
Products & Configurator

Interactive Configurator component:

Dropdowns for “Pattern,” “Thickness (10–15 mm),” “Finish (Matt/Gloss).”

Live preview of sheet mockup.

“Download Spec Sheet” and “View Installation Guide” buttons.

Material Specs Hub table: Material, Size (10×5 ft), Price (₹ 45/sq.ft.⁺), Features (fire‑retardant, moisture‑proof).

Inspiration Lab

Mood‑Board Gallery: grid of 4 “lookbooks” (Urban Minimal, Tropical Luxe, etc.)—hover reveals a 3‑second reel.

Auto‑play loops of styled spaces using Polymarble.

Support & Community

DIY Hub: embed 3–5 short “how‑to” videos (cutting, fixing, cleaning).

Architect & Builder Portal: gated login area offering bulk discounts, CAD/BIM downloads, technical FAQs.

SEO Micro‑Landing Pages (configure in router):

/marble-wall-sheet-madurai

/lightweight-stone-walling-chennai

Each with unique H1, meta description, 200 words of localized content, and product callouts.

3. MICRO‑INTERACTIONS & ACCESSIBILITY
Sounds:

“Clink” on configurator “Add Finish.”

Soft ripple + subtle tone on “Get Sample.”

ARIA labels: for all interactive controls.

Keyboard nav: ensure carousel, filters, configurator are fully keyboard‑accessible.

4. SEO & ANALYTICS
Schema Markup: inject JSON‑LD for Product, FAQ, LocalBusiness.

Meta & OpenGraph: update on each new page.

Google Analytics & Hotjar: verify tracking on new sections, funnels on “Get Sample” and “Quick Quote.”

5. ROLLOUT PHASES
Phase 1 (Week 1): Hero revamp, About timeline, Footer newsletter.

Phase 2 (Week 2): Gallery carousel & 3D hovers, Projects → Case Studies.

Phase 3 (Week 3): Build Products & Configurator page, Inspiration Lab.

Phase 4 (Week 4): Support Portal + SEO micro‑landing + analytics setup.

Implementation Notes:

Use Tailwind CSS (or your framework) for all styling.

Parallax: use CSS transform: translateZ() or JS scroll library.

Configurator: React stateful component or Vanilla JS with Canvas.

Videos: lazy‑load MP4 loops.

Ensure mobile‑first responsive breakpoints.
